Soil Sentinel is an innovative AI-powered project designed to monitor and analyze soil health using intelligent IoT-enabled microbial systems, aimed at promoting sustainable agriculture. It integrates real-time sensor technologies with machine learning algorithms to track key soil parameters such as moisture, temperature, pH, and the activity of beneficial microbes. By embedding biosensors in the soil and connecting them through microcontrollers like Arduino or ESP32, data is continuously collected and transmitted to a cloud platform for analysis. The system leverages AI models to interpret microbial behavior and environmental conditions, enabling early detection of soil degradation, nutrient deficiency, and potential threats to crop health. A dynamic web dashboard provides farmers and agricultural researchers with real-time visualizations, alerts, and predictive insights, empowering them to make informed decisions about irrigation, fertilization, and crop planning. Soil Sentinel not only helps in improving crop yield and reducing chemical usage but also supports long-term soil conservation by promoting eco-friendly and data-driven farming practices. This intelligent system bridges the gap between traditional agriculture and modern technology, offering a scalable solution for precision farming in both small-scale and large-scale agricultural settings.
